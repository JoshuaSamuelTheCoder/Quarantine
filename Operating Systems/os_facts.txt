OPERATING SYSTEMS AND ITS TYPES

Q1) What is a Operating System?
- controls execution of application programme
- act as interface between user and computer

Q2) What does an Operating System includes ?
-traffic controller
-scheduler
-memory management module
-i/o programme
-file system

Q3) What is the use of an OS?
-hardware abstraction
-resource management

Q4) What are various types of OS?
batch operating

    doesn't interact with computer directly
    less idle time,multiple user,handles large work
    costly,hard to debug
    ex: payroll systems,bank statements
    time sharing
    task is divided into time quantums(tq)
    multitasking systems
    less chances of duplication
    low relablity
    ex: unix
    distributed
    loosely coupled systems
    processors differ in size and functions
    high exchange speed,reduces load on host,computing power is fast
    expensive,failure of main network
    ex: locus
    netwok
    common server
    tightly coupled systems
    stable,enhanced security,updating is easy
    costly server,difficult to maintain
    ex: window server,linux,mac-os
    real time
    time accurate (defence,nuclear power plants)
    types:
        hard real time:
        * strict time constraint
        * no virtual memory
        2) soft real time:
        * less strict time constraint
    task-shifting is easy,application focused,error free
    limited task,heavy resource requirements,complex algorithm based
    ex: wepon system,air traffic control system
